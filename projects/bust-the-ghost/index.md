# üëª Bust the Ghost (Bayesian Inference Game)

**Stack:** Unity, C#, Blender  
**Repo:** <https://github.com/Adnane-Ahroum/BustTheGhost>

An interactive game that teaches **Bayesian inference** by having players update beliefs about a hidden ghost's location based on noisy sensors.

## Highlights
- Encodes priors and likelihoods; shows posterior updates visually.  
- Balances gameplay with pedagogical clarity.

## What I learned
Communicating probabilistic reasoning through UX and real‚Äëtime feedback loops.
